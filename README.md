# flight_paths

<strong>Flight paths function sourced Erik Enderlein</strong> on this project and Erik also helped guide me through this lab.

<h1>Flight paths function does the following:</h1>

-given a starting city and an ending city, will return a path between the two cities (including the two cities).
-also returns the total distance traveled between cities.
-appropriately handles the situation where no path exists.
